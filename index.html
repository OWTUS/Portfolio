        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Oisin Wells, and I am currently studying Software Design with a focus on Virtual Reality and Gaming at TUS Athlone.
          I have a passion for creating, from designing a game or by producing a web app that uses varied amounts of technology like MySQL for Databases or a website using standard HTML/CSS with JS. 
          My journey in software design of Four to Five years had allowed me to learn more languages for this field. I have also learnt from my many mistakes
          and Iâ€™m excited to continue to contribute on this field of work.

      <p>
        My technical skillset includes expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, MySQL, C++, C#, and Phyton. Having started with Java, my understanding only grew over time when I was introduced to the world of software development.
        And I have used these other languages to make other apps/games like in C# with the Uniy game engine, to create a interactive VR Demo. Or a app within Java to use the GUI to display shapes or develop a class that inherits another's classes attributes.

        <p>
          I developed a responsive web application using Java Facelets, MySQL, and JavaScript. This project involved creating a user-friendly interface, an interactive database that always updated, created or deleted new data like a user for logging into a site while also adding a level of security by using a JS script. Developed along side other devs, I also learned how a group of software developers would work together within a collaborating project
